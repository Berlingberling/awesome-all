# üëî Awesome Engineering Team Management [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

A compilation of advices, anecdotes, knowledge tidbits, discussions, industry small-talks and rants. A bibliography of sort, gathered the last few years while [transitioning my career from a software engineer to an engineer's manager](https://devtomanager.com/interviews/kevin-deldycke/). And later from a manager to a manager's managers (you all love recursion right?  ò‚Äø ò).

It is on this substrate that I crafted my management style, as I found anchoring the later with [the usual labels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_style#Types_of_management_styles) is way too limiting and short-sighted. Limiting as management is both of an art and a science. And short-sighted as a style shouldn't be taken at face-value and always be sensible to our fellow humans talents and the business context of the company.

## Engineering to Management Transition

The first step. The hardest: how to requalify oneself from an Individual Contributor (IC) to a front-line manager.

- You always been a developer. Being offered [a management position is not a promotion. It is a change in career](https://fractio.nl/2014/09/19/not-a-promotion-a-career-change/).
- [17 Reasons not to be a Manager](https://charity.wtf/2019/09/08/reasons-not-to-be-a-manager/) - An article to [discourage the faint-hearted recruits](https://youtu.be/b07887ZzKiw?t=40).

## Building Teams

You got the title and the pay grade. Congratulation! This doesn't make you a manager yet. Whether you inherit an already existing team or have to start from scratch, you'll need to practice the art of building (and consolidating) them.

- [Building and Motivating Engineering Teams](http://www.elidedbranches.com/2016/11/building-and-motivating-engineering.html) - What DO engineers want? Money, purpose and respect.
- [What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html) - ‚ÄúGoogle's data indicated that psychological safety, more than anything else, was critical to making a team work. (‚Ä¶) The behaviors that create psychological safety ‚Äî conversational turn-taking and empathy ‚Äî are part of the same unwritten rules we often turn to, as individuals, when we need to establish a bond.‚Äù
- [Paper we love: Software Engineering Organizations](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/tree/master/software_engineering_orgs) - ‚ÄúThe practice of software engineering, and its history is, itself, a complex study in humanity, coordination, and communication.‚Äù
- [Teams are like bread](https://blog.jessitron.com/2019/06/15/teams-are-like-bread/) - ‚ÄúIf you have one team where the magic is flourishing, don't kill it. Feed it, grow it, and let it be a source of further strong teams. No rushing.‚Äù
- [Developer Tropes: "Google does it"](https://tomaytotomato.com/developer-tropes-2/) - It's [cargo-cultish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult) to imitate the big names in our industry as a path to success. Instead, the take home from this article ‚Äúwould be that managers and other leaders should be like ecologists; who measure, observe and nurture their ecosystems. Doing so will help build a unique workplace that will yield great results.‚Äù


## Roles

On the profiles, attitude, behaviors, and expectations between developers, managers and executives.

### Executives

Executives are the senior/highest management layers of a company. They reports to a board of directors in bigger companies, or directly to the shareholders in smaller ones. Leadership is expected at this level. As a manager these are the people you report to.

- [What do executives do, anyway?](https://apenwarr.ca/log/20190926) - Paraphrasing [Andy Grove's book, High Output Management](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0679762884), ‚Äúthe job of an executive is: to define and enforce culture and values for their whole organization, and to ratify good decisions.‚Äù The article also details the failures modes of a CEO: forcing his own decisions downstream, or various ways of not resolving conflicts.
- [Executives ratify decisions made on the spot](https://twitter.com/kdeldycke/status/1088001688722644992) - Refines the concept above adapting [Tolstoy's thesis to business](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18089716).
- [Army Leadership and the Profession](https://fas.org/irp/doddir/army/adp6_22.pdf) - Establishes and describes what leaders should be and do.
- [US Air Force's Strategic Leadership Studies](http://leadership.au.af.mil/sls-skil.htm) - A reference of leadership's competencies and skills.
- [What Only the CEO Can Do](https://hbr.org/2009/05/what-only-the-ceo-can-do) - TL;DR: ‚Äú1. Defining and interpreting the meaningful "outside" of the company; 2. Answering the two-part question: What business are we in and what business are we not in? 3. Balancing sufficient yield in the present with necessary investment in the future; 4. Shaping the values and standards of the organization.‚Äù
- [How CEOs Manage Time](https://hbr.org/2018/07/the-leaders-calendar) - A study on what CEO of large companies spent their time on, and how. Opens a new window into what leadership is all about and into its many components and dimensions.
- [Operations and Internal Communication Strategies For Effective CEOs](https://www.sametab.com/blog/operations-and-internal-communication-strategies-for-effective-ceos) - After insisting on the importance of context and narratives, the author provide an interesting template (good for inspiration) of ritual and recurring internal communication devices.
- ‚ÄúThese are the things we [marketers] used to do with individuals and bodies. They've all become automated. The CIO is the marketing chief now.‚Äù - [Regis McKenna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regis_McKenna), from [2017's Silicon Valley Leaders Symposium](https://youtu.be/5Z13NI0SuyA?t=2026).
- [Narcissistic CEOs Weaken Collaboration and Integrity](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/narcissistic-ceos-weaken-collaboration-integrity) - ‚ÄúThe prototypic visionary leader profile is so similar to that of a narcissist, if boards aren't careful, they're going to end up choosing people who are narcissistic as CEOs‚Äù.
- ‚ÄúHiring isn't the challenge. The challenge is finding people who can be effective while working for executives whose only qualifications and training are narcissistic levels of self confidence.‚Äù ([source](https://twitter.com/kellan/status/1205113384632500224)).

### CTO & VP of Engineering

In tech companies these roles are critical, and the frontier between the two is often blurry.

- [CTO vs VP Engineering: What's the Difference?](https://www.ivyexec.com/career-advice/2015/cto-versus-vp-engineering-whats-the-difference/) - TL;DR: CTO manage a small staff of hackers. VP of Engineering lead an organization of engineers.

- [The different skills needed to be a successful CTO](https://madewithlove.be/one-job-many-roles-the-different-skills-needed-to-be-a-successful-cto/) - The premise is a little misleading, as what is detailed there is the journey, in a startup, of the technical founder growing with the company to become a CTO. At which point the position described in the article is not CTO, but VP of Engineering.
- [‚ÄúThat's usually about the time I nope right out of the interview‚Äù](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19188246) - Bad signs of a CTO trying to recruit an engineering manager, or the perils of not believing in hierarchies.

### Engineering Managers

Managers came in all form and shape, and the title and daily activities varies a lot depending on companies. When developers directly reports to you, you find yourself at the first management level: you are a front-line engineering manager.

- [What are the signs that you have a great manager?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20230133) - ‚ÄúThe irony is that you don't really notice a great manager.‚Äù

### Consultants

- ‚ÄúA consultant is someone 4 pages ahead in the manual‚Äù ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20786286)).
- ‚ÄúThe value that most orgs get from a consultant (‚Ä¶) is the political cover to make changes they knew they should make all along, but didn't have the social capital or the focus to make those changes‚Äù ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21714791)). And that's the reason bureaucracies and highly political organizations are fertile grounds for consultants.

### Coding Challenge

The absence of coding exercise will left the door open to fraud. OTOH, if elitist challenges decrease the number of false-positive, you'll pass on perfectly capable and great developers. Now it is your job as manager to find balance between these two extremes, and set the tone on how to have the candidate demonstrate coding skills.

## Technical Stack

You're no longer an engineer. You shouldn't code anymore. Still, your team is responsible for the systems, technology and all the processes surrounding them.

### Systems

Whatever the technology used behind the scene, we are building systems first.

- [Second-system effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-system_effect) - ‚ÄúTendency of small, elegant, and successful systems, to be succeeded by over-engineered, bloated systems‚Äù.
- [Living with Complexity, by Donald A. Norman](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0262014866) - In which we learn that, based on [Tesler's law of the conservation of complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_conservation_of_complexity), ‚Äúthe total complexity of a system is a constant: as you make the person's interaction simpler, the hidden complexity behind the scenes increases. Make one part of the system simpler, said Tesler, and the rest of the system gets more complex.‚Äù.
- [The Efficiency-Destroying Magic of Tidying Up](https://florentcrivello.com/index.php/2019/09/04/the-efficiency-destroying-magic-of-tidying-up/) - ‚ÄúEfficiency tends to look messy, and good looks tend to be inefficient.‚Äù A reminder that sometimes we should just accept [the messiness of the world](https://github.com/kdeldycke/awesome-falsehood).
- ‚ÄúPeople who excel at software design become convinced that they have a unique ability to understand any kind of system at all, from first principles, without prior training, thanks to their superior powers of analysis. Success in the artificially constructed world of software design promotes a dangerous confidence.‚Äù - A reminder of the needs of humility and recognition of limits in our industry, [from a panel on the Moral Economy of Tech](https://idlewords.com/talks/sase_panel.htm).

### Technology

- [Industry Data Models](http://www.databaseanswers.org/data_models/) - A huge list of database templates to represent any business process.
- [Choose Boring Technology](http://boringtechnology.club) - ‚ÄúBoring, in the sense that it's well understood.‚Äù

Libraries, wether software or audio loops, are tools. A typical case of [NIH syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here) transposed to music production.

### Engineering Practices

- [Code reviews at Google](https://github.com/google/eng-practices/blob/master/review/reviewer/speed.md#why-should-code-reviews-be-fast-why) - ‚ÄúWhy Should Code Reviews Be Fast? (‚Ä¶) To optimize for the speed at which a team of developers can produce a product together, as opposed to optimizing for the speed at which an individual developer can write code.‚Äù

A buried gap in Tetris represents technical debt. (‚Ä¶) Paying down technical debt keeps you competitive. It keeps you in the game.‚Äù
- [Goodbye, Clean Code](https://overreacted.io/goodbye-clean-code/) - ‚ÄúMy boss invited me for a one-on-one chat where they politely asked me to revert my change. I was aghast. The old code was a mess, and mine was clean! (‚Ä¶) I see now that my ‚Äòrefactoring‚Äô was a disaster in two ways: I didn't talk to the person who wrote it; My code traded the ability to change requirements for reduced duplication‚Äù.

## Project Management

If product management is about *what* is to be developed of the product, then project management activities answers on *how* to deliver that development. It is all about the execution, with a particular attention to delivery critical path and planning.

But don't worry too much, every company has its own definition of the two roles, and sometimes hybrid positions.

- [The art of destroying software](https://vimeo.com/108441214) - Greg Young described a good way to deal with requirements volatility: optimize from the beginning to be able to delete your code, and structure your code so that any part of it is no bigger than 1 week's worth of coding. So that any part can be re-written in 1 week.
- [Requirements volatility is the core problem of software engineering](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/02/20/requirements-volatility-is-the-core-problem-of-software-engineering/) - ‚ÄúStart by accepting that change is inevitable. (‚Ä¶) As a consequence of this, software is never finished, only abandoned. (‚Ä¶) This means that no software product is ever exactly, perfectly satisfactory.‚Äù

## Key Performance Indicator (KPI)

KPIs are a set of quantitative measurements at the team or organizational level, to measure the success of the business.

- ‚ÄúNumerical goals set for other people, without a road map to reach the goal, have effects opposite to the effects sought.‚Äù - [W. Edwards Deming](https://quotes.deming.org/authors/W._Edwards_Deming/quote/2068-2)

## Literacy

It is not only about reading and writing. It encompass all the social practice, context sharing and communication surrounding the activity and production of a team.

Especially a software team, which will generate a huge amount of knowledge. All this knowledge is fragile and about to be lost for good. Unless you materialization it in the form of writing.

### Knowledge

- ‚ÄúIn a highly political environment there are two ways to create change, one is through overt manipulation, which is to collect political power to yourself and then exert it to enact change, and the other is covert manipulation, which is to enact change subtly enough that the political organism doesn't react.
